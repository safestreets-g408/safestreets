    * Images and GPS coordinates are securely transmitted to the backend server
    * Automatic AI analysis of submitted images
    * Progress tracking during submission

* **Road Validation:**
    * AI-based validation to ensure images contain actual road surfaces
    * Prevents submission of irrelevant images

* **Status Tracking:**
    * Field workers can view the history of their submitted reports
    * Real-time status updates (pending/in-progress/resolved)
    * Detailed view of assigned repair tasks

* **Notifications System:**
    * Real-time push notifications for new assignments
    * Task reminders and status updates

## 2. AI-Powered Damage Detection

* **Multi-Model Architecture:**
    * Vision Transformer (ViT) for damage classification
    * YOLO object detection (v8 with v5 fallback) for damage localization
    * CNN-based road surface classifier for image validation
    * Google Gemini for natural language report generation

* **Damage Classification:**
    * Identifies multiple damage types including:
        * Potholes
        * Surface cracks
        * Alligator cracking
        * Erosion/wear

* **Severity Assessment:**
    * AI-based assessment of damage severity
    * Considers factors like crack width, area size, and damage density
    * Provides standardized severity levels (Low/Medium/High/Critical)

* **Visual Damage Localization:**
    * Bounding box identification of damage areas
    * Annotated image generation for visual reference
    * Confidence scores for detected damages

* **Text Summary Generation:**
    * AI-generated natural language descriptions using Google Gemini
    * Structured damage reports with:
        * Damage type and classification
        * Severity assessment
        * Priority recommendations
        * Suggested actions
    * Caching system for efficient report generation

* **Fallback Mechanisms:**
    * Robust error handling for AI model failures
    * Graceful degradation when specific models are unavailable
    * Alternative processing paths for different scenarios

## 3. Backend Server

    * Integration with AI Models Server
    * Result processing and database storage

* **Task Assignment:**
    * Admin assignment of repair tasks to field workers
    * Geographic matching based on worker regions
    * Maximum assignment limits to prevent overloading

* **Email Automation:**
    * Daily status updates to field workers
    * Notification emails for high-priority damages
    * HTML email templates with responsive design

* **Caching System:**
    * Redis-based caching for performance optimization
    * JWT cache for efficient token validation
    * Graceful fallback when Redis is unavailable

## 4. Admin Portal (Web Dashboard)
